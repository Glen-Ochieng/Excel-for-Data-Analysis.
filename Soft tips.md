Putting data in Tables is among the simplest ways to be efficient in Excel. It allows you to place column headers, which allow for a function to act cohesively on a group of cells. 

*Eg*

= UPPER(Table1[#Headers]] )

>This will create a upper case column headers of the table headers in the cell you wrote the function in.
